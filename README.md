# ‚è≥ Time Series Forecasting Repository

Welcome to my **Time Series Forecasting** repository! This space is dedicated to exploring and implementing various time series techniques to analyze temporal patterns, trends, and forecast future outcomes using real-world data.

Whether it's business sales, stock trends, weather patterns, or user behavior, time series forecasting plays a vital role in data-driven decision making. Through this repository, I demonstrate practical implementations using Python and industry-standard models.
